## Time Tracking Dashboard

A small dashboard built for a software engineering project at DHBW.
It provides analysis for issue-based time tracking, which GitLab itself does not natively offer.

## Configuration

### 1. GitLab API Configuration

Edit `config/dashboardConfig.ts` and update the following settings:

```typescript
export const GITLAB_CONFIG = {
    API_URL: 'https://gitlab.com/api/graphql',
    GROUP_PATH: 'your-group/your-project', // Replace with your GitLab group/project path
    TOKEN: 'your-gitlab-token', // Replace with your GitLab personal access token
    ISSUE_BASE_URL: 'https://gitlab.com/your-group/your-project/-/issues'
} as const;
```

#### Getting Your GitLab Token

1. Go to GitLab â†’ Settings â†’ Access Tokens
2. Create a new token with `read_api` scope
3. Copy the token and paste it in the config file

### 2. Team Members Configuration

Update the team members list in `config/dashboardConfig.ts`:

```typescript
export const TEAM_MEMBERS = [
    "username1",
    "username2", 
    "username3",
    // Add all team member usernames
] as const;
```

### 3. Date Range Configuration

Update the date range in `app/page.tsx`:

```typescript
// Set your desired date range
const startDate = new Date('2024-01-01'); // Start date
const endDate = new Date('2024-12-31');   // End date
```

### 4. Categories Configuration

The dashboard uses these default categories. You can modify them in `config/dashboardConfig.ts`:

```typescript
export const CATEGORIES = {
    REQUIREMENTS_ENGINEERING: "Requirements Engineering",
    ENTWURF: "Entwurf", 
    IMPLEMENTATION_TEST: "Implementation & Test",
    PROJEKTMANAGEMENT: "Projektmanagement"
} as const;
```



> [!WARNING]  
> Make sure your GitLab issues have labels that match these categories.
