## Time Tracking Dashboard

A small dashboard built for a software engineering project at DHBW.
It provides analysis for issue-based time tracking, which GitLab itself does not natively offer.

> [!NOTE]  
> This project was developed in a short amount of time, so the code quality is not great.  
> Itâ€™s more a "it just works somehow" kind of project.

## Features

- ðŸ“Š **Project Overview**: Sprint metrics, velocity tracking, and category distribution
- ðŸ“ˆ **Time Series Charts**: Weekly performance trends and team activity comparison
- ðŸŽ¯ **Team & Categories**: Pie charts and bar charts for time allocation analysis
- âš¡ **Productivity Analysis**: Hourly and weekly productivity patterns
- ðŸ‘¥ **Team Collaboration**: Network visualization of team collaboration
- ðŸ“‹ **Issue Analysis**: Issue complexity and time analysis
- ðŸ“… **Detailed Activity**: GitHub-style activity heatmap

## Configuration (env variables)

This project now uses environment variables for configuration. Sensitive values (like the GitLab token) must be provided as server-side environment variables and are not embedded into client bundles.

Copy the example file and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# then edit .env and set GITLAB_TOKEN
```

- GITLAB_TOKEN (required, server-side): your GitLab personal access token with `read_api` scope. Keep this secret.
- NEXT_PUBLIC_GITLAB_GROUP_PATH (optional): project/group path used for GraphQL queries (visible to client).
- NEXT_PUBLIC_GITLAB_API_URL / GITLAB_API_URL (optional): API endpoint if using a self-hosted GitLab.
- NEXT_PUBLIC_GITLAB_ISSUE_BASE_URL (optional): the public issue URL base used to create links.

There is a server-side API proxy at `POST /api/gitlab` that forwards GraphQL queries to GitLab using the server-side `GITLAB_TOKEN`. Client code calls this endpoint so the token is never sent to the browser.

Other non-secret settings, teams and categories are still configured in `config/dashboardConfig.ts`.

### Running with Docker Compose

Make sure you have copied `.env.example` to `.env` and set `GITLAB_TOKEN`.

Start the app with docker-compose:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000. To stop it:

```bash
docker compose down
```

> [!WARNING]  
> Make sure your GitLab issues have labels that match these categories.
